class Opal < Formula
  # Binary formula: installs the prebuilt release binary.
  #
  # This used to build from source, which meant `depends_on "zig" => :build` and
  # `depends_on xcode: ["15.0", :build]` — so `brew install debpalash/tap/opal`
  # died on any machine that had only the Command Line Tools:
  #
  #   opal: A full installation of Xcode.app 15.0 is required to compile
  #   this software. Installing just the Command Line Tools is not sufficient.
  #
  # Nobody should need a 15 GB Xcode download to install a media player. We already
  # publish a compiled arm64 binary with every release, so install that.

  # Runtime — this is a bare binary, so it links against Homebrew's dylibs. (The
  # .app bundle from the same release vendors these instead and needs none of them;
  # that is what scripts/install.sh installs by default.)

  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      Opal stores config + models in ~/.config/opal/.

      This formula installs the command-line binary. For the GUI app bundle
      (self-contained — it vendors mpv/SDL and needs no Homebrew deps):
        curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/debpalash/Opal/main/scripts/install.sh | sh

      To enable voice/STT, keep `whisper-cpp` and `ffmpeg` on PATH.
